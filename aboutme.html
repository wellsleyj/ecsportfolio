                   <h3> Football </h3>
            <p>I love foobtall. I have been playing football since I was 10 years old. I love everything about the game and I have learned so much from it.</p>
            <p>I love watching the Utah Utes and New England Patriots, as those are my favorite teams. I prefer to watch college football over professional football.</p> 
            <p>One thing I also love about football is weight training because I think it is super fun to see how much you can grow and how much stronger you can get in an amount of time if you put a good amount of effort into it.</p>
            <p>The lessons I have learned in football are so much relateable to real life lessons. For example, how to work your way up on the depth chart on a team when you're discouraged, or learn to work with people that you don't neccesarily like, but just have to find a way to make it work. </p>
