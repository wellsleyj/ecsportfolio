            <p>I love football! I have been playing this sport since I was ten years old. Ever since I have played it, I love how the game works, the physiciality, the lessons learned along the way.</p>
            <p>I also love watching football. My favorite teams are the Utah Utes and the New England Patriots. My faovite players are Tom Brady and Rob Gronkowski from the New England Patriots, Steve Smith from both Utah and the NFL, and Britain Covey from Utah, Cameron Rising from Utah, and Francis Bernard who also played at the University of Utah.</p>
            <p>I have been a Utah Utes fan and New England Patriots fan since I started playing football(2016). During that time as a Utah fan, I have experienced losing twice in our divison championship, followed by winning back-to-back championships(4 appearances in 5 years). However, that one year the Utes did not make it to the championship game was during 2020, when the world was run by COVID-19. Unortunately, that was the year that the Utes had a breakout player in only playing five games. But, on Christmas Day of 2020, he died from gun-inflicted wounds. Later that year, in 2021, his friend who decided to take his number in memorial or him, 22, also got shot, ironically 9 months to the day. So, the number 22 is now retired at the University of Utah, making the number to be unplayable now.</p>
            <p>Being a New Engalnd Patriots fan, I would say, would be considered a treat as I was basically born into the New Engand Patriots dynasty of the great player of all time and the greatest coach of all time, Tom Brady and Bill Belichick. During this time, from 2000 - 2019, the went to 9 super bowls and won 6 of them. the first I started watching them play was my favorite NFL game of all time, Super Bowl LI. It was when in the third and fourth quarter the Patriots were down 28-3 to the Atlanta Falcons. They came back and scored all 28 points to tie the game, thus taking the first ever super bowl to overtime. In one posession, the Patriots were sueper bowl champions after being down 28-3.</p>
